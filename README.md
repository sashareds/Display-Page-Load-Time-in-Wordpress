Display-Page-Load-Time-in-Wordpress
===================================

This is just a simple snippet code to display page load time in wordrpess.

It will generate a line of text in you page. Like this line bellow 
`<!-- Page generated 184 queries in 1.7686 seconds ( 95.46% PHP, 4.54% MySQL ) -->`


The initial code is not mine. I've nicked it from this blog http://usefulmix.com/wordpress-page-load-statistics/
I've just a bit altered it for my preferences.
